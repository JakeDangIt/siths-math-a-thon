          The 2026 SITHS Math-a-Thon is fundraising for Luv Michael, 
          a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering autistic individuals. 
          Founded in honor of Michael Kessaris, an autistic young man, 
          Luv Michael was created to support adults with autism through 
          job training, education, employment opportunities, and community living programs. 
          All proceeds will go toward supporting 
          Luv Michael's programs and services for the autistic community.
