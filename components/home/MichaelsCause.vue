                <p>The 2025 SITHS Math-a-Thon is fundraising for Michael's Cause, a Staten Island organization inspired by
                    Michael Capolongo, a current 17-year-old student at Tottenville High School. Michael was diagnosed
                    with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and the organization was formed with the goal of raising awareness
                    and research about the disease. All proceeds goes to Michael's Cause and the research towards
                    Duchenne.</p>
